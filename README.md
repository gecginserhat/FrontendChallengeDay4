Day 4: Flexbox & Responsive Design - Crafting Flexible Layouts <br/>

🎯 Day 4 of my 21-day coding challenge, and today I focused on mastering CSS Flexbox and responsive design! 📱💻<br/>

🔍 Here's what I learned:<br/>

What is Flexbox?: An introduction to Flexbox, the powerful layout tool for creating flexible and responsive designs.<br/>
Flexbox Container Properties: Explored properties like display: flex, justify-content, align-items, and more to control the layout of flex containers.<br/>
Flex Item Properties: Learned how to manipulate individual flex items with properties like flex-grow, flex-shrink, and order.<br/>
Responsive Design: Delved into responsive design principles to ensure layouts look great on any screen size.<br/>
Media Queries: Used media queries to apply different styles based on device screen size, making designs truly responsive.<br/>
🔥 Flexbox and media queries are game-changers for modern web design. Excited to keep building on these skills tomorrow!<br/>
